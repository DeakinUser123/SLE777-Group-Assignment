# SLE777-Group-Assignment
This project is part for the SLE777 at Deakin University.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Overview and Objectives

The main aim of this project is to assist collaborators in understanding and analyzing biological data more effectively.

Part 1 focuses on the analysis of gene expression data in TSV format. This section will include visualizations to facilitate insights into the frequency of gene expression. Additionally, we will filter and analyze Tree Circumference data collected over 20 years to uncover differences across various tree sites.


Part 2 involves a comparative analysis of gene sequences, nucleotide frequencies, and amino acid biases between E. coli and C. baratii. This part will also highlight comparisons between the two organisms, employing data visualizations to support our findings and conclusions.

## Project Contents
In this repository, you will find two reports named "Part_x_Report", each highlighting a different part of our project. Alongside these, there is a respective R notebook that includes all the code we used, "SLE777 Group Assignment Part 1". The reports provide a detailed overview of our findings and share the strategies we employed to solve the problems, along with the necessary code to reproduce our results.

## Future Work
* Potential extensions of the analysis
* Adding new datasets to gain deeper insights
