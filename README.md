# SLE777-Group-Assignment
This project is for SLE777 at Deakin University.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is for collaborators to understand and analyse data.

Part 1 involves analysis of gene expression data in a tsv format, as well as data visualisations to draw conclusions about frequency of gene expression. Furthermore It also involves data filtering and analysis of Tree Circumference data across 20 years to draw conclusions between sites of trees. 


Part 2 involves comparing gene sequences, nucleotide frequencies and amino acid biases for E. coli and C. baratii. This also involves comparisons between the two, using data visualisation to draw conclusions.
